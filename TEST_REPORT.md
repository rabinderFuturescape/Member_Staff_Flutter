## Issues and Recommendations

### Minor Issues

1. **OTP Expiration Handling**: The UI could provide a clearer indication of when an OTP is about to expire.
   - **Recommendation**: Add a countdown timer for OTP expiration.

2. **Schedule Conflict Visualization**: The calendar view could better highlight conflicting time slots.
   - **Recommendation**: Use a distinct color or pattern for conflicting slots.

3. **Error Messages**: Some error messages could be more user-friendly.
   - **Recommendation**: Review and improve error message wording.

### Recommendations for Future Enhancements

1. **Offline Support**: Add offline support for viewing staff schedules.
2. **Push Notifications**: Implement push notifications for schedule changes.
3. **Analytics**: Add analytics to track usage patterns and identify improvement areas.
4. **Accessibility**: Enhance accessibility features for users with disabilities.

## Conclusion

The Member Staff module has been thoroughly tested and meets all the specified requirements. The module is ready for integration with the parent OneApp.

The implementation follows best practices for:
- Authentication and authorization
- Data validation and error handling
- User experience and interface design
- Performance and security

The mock data environment provides a solid foundation for development and testing, with realistic test scenarios that cover all the main user flows.

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**: Conduct integration testing with the parent OneApp.
2. **User Acceptance Testing**: Conduct UAT with real users.
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production environment.
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for the production environment.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement.
